# Lets_drums

# What's this ?
This is simply project with drum-kit simulator.

1.You can play drums with a mouse or keyboard
2. You can set tempo (BPM).
3. You can show or hide the drums elements.
4. If you click "show Keyboard", you can see the keyboard keys that you need to press to play.

# Used technologies: React, Sass


In the future I would like to: 
1. add an option where you can arrange your rhythm, save it and play it. 
2. Create RWD / mobile version. Now is only for desktop.
